# Configuring the Development Environment

We run react and the server (receiving data) at the same time:

1) In the Production folder:

#### in this folder is the final product node.js (express)

### `npm install`
### `node app.js`

2) In the React folder:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

!Proxy between servers is configured!
